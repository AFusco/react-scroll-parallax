# Horizontal Scroll

The controller isn't limited to the typical vertical scrolling. To setup a horizontal scrolling document you'll need to set the `scrollAxis` in the [`<ParallaxProvider>`](/docs/usage/components/parallax-provider) to `horizontal`.

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <ParallaxProvider scrollAxis="horizontal">
    <HorizontalContainer />
  </ParallaxProvider>
);
```

Once the provider is setup, you can start creating effects as usual. Here's an example that uses a few layers with repeating backgrounds.

## Source Code

To achieve the above effect, layers are stacked absolutely in a container. A `speed` is assigned to the middle and closest tree images - the closest moves the fastest. Then the `left` and `right` are extended so the edges are never seen. A `targetElement` is also assigned to the containing `div` and passed to each parallax layer so that the progress rate is calculated equally. Here's the setup:

```tsx
function DemonWoods() {
  const target = useRef(null);

  const mid = useParallax({
    speed: 50,
    targetElement: target.current,
  });
  const close = useParallax({
    speed: 100,
    targetElement: target.current,
  });

  const midExtend = 50 * 5 * -1;
  const closeExtend = 100 * 5 * -1;

  return (
    <div className={styles.root} ref={target}>
      <div
        style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${imageBg})`, left: 0, right: 0 }}
        className={styles.layer}
      />
      <div
        style={{
          backgroundImage: `url(${imageFar})`,
          left: 0,
          right: 0,
        }}
        className={styles.layer}
      />
      <div
        style={{
          backgroundImage: `url(${imageMid})`,
          left: midExtend,
          right: midExtend,
        }}
        className={styles.layer}
        ref={mid.ref}
      />
      <div
        style={{
          backgroundImage: `url(${imageClose})`,
          left: closeExtend,
          right: closeExtend,
        }}
        className={styles.layer}
        ref={close.ref}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
