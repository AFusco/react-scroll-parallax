## Support

If you're having trouble and need support please consider the following so that help is more immediate:

- Share a live link to your website and a link to your public repository (or)
- Create a working CodeSandbox that demonstrates what you're trying to do. Here's a [CodeSandbox template to fork](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-scroll-parallax-template-x6lus4)
- Describe what you're trying to achieve -- a design or prototype would help.
- Share related code blocks that you may have
